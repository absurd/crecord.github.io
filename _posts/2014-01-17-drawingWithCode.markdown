<p>Drawing With Code is a workshop that introduces computer programming as an art medium. There are three sections: Making up the Rule, Creating Drawing Tools, and New Places to Put Drawings. Participants get right into programming. They modify existing code examples that do everything from simulating how birds flock to using open source facial tracking to make drawings with their noses. </p> 

<p>I've done this workshop four different times! The first time was in collaboration with <a href="http://nathantrevino.com/"> Nathan Trevino </a> and was for the 2014 Draw Symposium.<a href="https://drawingwithcode.wordpress.com/"> Here is our blog </a> for the original workshop. The second time was as a visiting instructor at the Ellis Girl's Middle School with assistance from Andrew Bueno. The most recent time was as educational display at the Carnegie Science Center. All the teaching materials for those are <a href="https://github.com/crecord/DrawingWithCodeTeachingMaterials">Here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/crecord/DrawingWithCode-ScienceCenter">Here</a> on my Github.</p>
