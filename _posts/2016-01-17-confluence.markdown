<p>Confluence was an archaeological expedition in unearthing the ephemeral and seemingly trivial aspects of Pittsburgh, such as the movement of waterand rust on bridges, that cannot be wiped away by homogenizing forces or transmuted virtually. We solidified these fleeting moments by pouring moltenwax into the local rivers, capturing the currents and ecology of each body of water, and collecting rust off various bridges. </p>
