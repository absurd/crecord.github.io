<p>Florum is a mobile app for realtors. It provides them with a way to foster relationships with their clients on the go, which ultimately leads to referrals and return business. The goal of this project was to build a mobile application for workers on the go using a user centered design driven approach. Our team chose to work with realtors because they presented a unique design challenge with their very busy schedules with multiple clients and on the go job.</p>
<p>Over the course of a month team Florum (<a href = "http://www.ginaassaf.com/" target="_blank" >Gina Assaf</a> and <a href = "http://www.binxed.com/" target="_blank" >Nancy Chen</a> and I) did in the field research to identify the needs of  our target realtor population, synthesized the data, visioned, paper prototyped, user tested, created design specs and a concept video.</p>
<h1>Research and Synthesis</h1> 
<p>We interviewed multiple agents at three real-estate companies and created an online survey to better understand the work environment and existing technology. We then used a process called affinity diagramming to synthesize and draw design principles from our in the field observations.</p>

<h1>Design</h1> 
<p>Based off of our design principles and resulting ideation sessions we did a low fidelity paper prototype, which we then tested with realtors in the field.</p>

<p>We then used the feedback from our user testing to create our final iteration of Florum! </p>
